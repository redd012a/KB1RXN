# SSH Access to cPanel Servers

For security purposes, we lock down SSH access to our platform by IP address. If you wish to gain SSH access to your account, please raise a support ticket detailing your public IP address. This can be found by visiting:

We can then white-list your IP address, allowing to log in.
