# Introduction to Nginx and LEMP on Ubuntu

This tutorial series helps sysadmins set up a new web server using the LEMP stack, focusing on Nginx setup with virtual blocks. This will let you serve multiple websites from one Droplet. You'll start by setting up your Ubuntu server and end with multiple virtual blocks set up for your websites. An Nginx configuration guide is included at the end for reference.
