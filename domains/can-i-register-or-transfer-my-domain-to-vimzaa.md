# Can I register or transfer my domain to Vimzaa

Yes, we do provide domain registration and transfer services.

If you are willing to register or transfer your domain to Vimzaa, you may proceed with the registration and/or transfer at the checkout while buying web hosting services or at the Client Area.

In order to register and/or transfer the domain separately \(without web hosting services\), you need to be registered to our internal [`Client Area`](https://vimzaa.com/clientarea.php).

After the registration is performed, log in to your Client Area, click to _**Services &gt; Add new domains**_. At the displayed page you will see both options â€“ domain registration and transfer.

Please note, that in order to transfer your domain, it needs to be _**active for at least 60 days**_.
