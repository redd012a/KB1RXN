# How do I transfer a domain name to Vimzaa?

 Before initiating the transfer of a non-UK domain \(e.g. .COM / .NET / .ORG\) you will need to ensure that it has been unlocked by your current provider. Please check with them if you are unsure.  
  
To transfer a domain name to us, please login to your client area at vimzaa.com and select “Domains -&gt; Transfer Domains to Us”  
  
Next, enter the domain name then click Transfer.
