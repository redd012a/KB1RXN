# How do I add another domain to my Hosting Account?

To add a new domain to your existing hosting account:

1. Log into your cPanel control panel
2. Click `Addon Domains`
3. Complete the form to add the domain into your hosting account

This ensures that the site runs independently and cannot be influenced by settings within the `public_html` folder.

You can also define your desired FTP username and password if applicable.

Once added and DNS propagated \(this can take up to 24 hours\), the domain will function without issue.

Once you've added the domain, you can select the `Redirects` option in cPanel if you want to simply point the new domain at another.
