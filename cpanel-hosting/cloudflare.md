# Cloudflare

Any website can deploy CloudFlare, regardless of your underlying platform. By integrating closely with Vimzaa, we make the process of setting up CloudFlare "1 click easy" through your existing Vimzaa cPanel dashboard. Just look for the CloudFlare icon, choose the domain you want to enable, and click the orange cloud. That's it!

## Cloudflare Railgun™

### What is Railgun?

Railgun ensures that the connection between your origin server and the Cloudflare network is as fast as possible.

Railgun is a WAN optimization technology that we offer our hosting customers in partnership with a company called CloudFlare.

CloudFlare’s Railgun technology greatly speeds up the delivery of non-cached pages. While CloudFlare automatically caches 65% of the resources needed to make up a page, 35% can't be cached because the resources are dynamically generated or marked as 'do not cache'. That 35% is often the initial HTML of the page that must be downloaded first. CloudFlare Railgun speeds this remaining 35%.

### What are the benefits of Railgun?

Websites running Railgun show a 143% improvement in HTML load times and a 90% decrease in Time To First Byte \(TTFB\) responses.
