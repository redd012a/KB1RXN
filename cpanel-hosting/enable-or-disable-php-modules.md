# Enable or disable PHP modules

We provide the facility to enable/disable PHP modules / libraries per account.

To enable a specific PHP module or alter your domains PHP version, please follow the steps below:

1. Login to your cPanel
2. From the drop-down list, change the PHP version from the default \(Native\) to the desired PHP version, for example 5.4 \(please note that you can still select the same version as the native version\)
3. Click 'Set as current'
4. A list of available modules / libraries will appear.  Use the tickboxes to enable or disable specific libraries
5. Click Save to confirm the changes

Once updated, the selected modules will then be active on your domain. This may take a few moments to take effect.
